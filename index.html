		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> I graduated from Colorado State University with a bachelor's of science in computer science. I then went to work for Capital One for a year as a software engineer. There, I built performance tests for their Kafka pipeline and built a Chrome extension to improve their data registration process. Now, I work for Amazon as a software engineer in Santa Monica. I look forward to learning new web technologies in this class like Swift.</p>
