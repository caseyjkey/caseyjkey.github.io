  "description": "For this year's portfolio, I focused on creating a website for acquiring freelance work and project exposure. Compared to previous portfolios, this application is a single page with a focus on easily updating and adding content.<br /><br /> To accomplish this task, I converted a static page into a React project.\nThe most difficult parts of this project were styling and evaluating my skills numerically.\n<br /><br /> To make this website easier to update, I decided to use Gatsby to allow content creation via a dashboard.\nFinally, I am most proud of the administrator dashboard where I can modify the look and content without diving into code."
