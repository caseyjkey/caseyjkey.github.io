  "description": "My team developed real-time business inteligence dashboards during our summer 2019 internship at Oracle in Reston, VA. <br /><br /> Our goal for this project was to create a proof-of-concept of Oracle Cloud's services for a bank. This lead to an executive view of actionable insights for increasing revenue by cross-selling bank services. We created dashboards, generated insight reports, and made a targeted recommendation. <br /> Our product demonstrated the capabilities of Oracle Autonomous Database by consolidating data across many systems. With this data, we used tools such as Oracle Analytics Cloud for intuitive data visualiztions. Overall, we created four dashboards analyzing revenue sourcers, the customer, and profitability. <br /><br /> At the end of the internship, we presented our work to the office, including our manager and mentor. My favorite memory from this internship was a tubing trip down the Potomac river. I am thankful for the opportunity to work at a top software company where I met many talented people."
